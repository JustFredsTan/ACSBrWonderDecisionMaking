        summer: "You lean towards kindness when you make decisions. You often move towards those who are left out or hurting, even when it costs you socially. Like Summer, your choices show moral courage and compassion.",
        savannah: "You are highly aware of image, impression, and social position. Your decisions often consider how you will be seen by others. Like Savannah, you may sometimes choose popularity or safety over authenticity—but you also have the potential to use that awareness for good.",
        julian: "Your decisions are often about control, strength, and not appearing vulnerable. When uncomfortable, you may react with sarcasm, criticism, or dominance. Like Julian, there is a lot beneath the surface that could change if you faced your own fears honestly.",
        jack: "Your decision-making balances conscience and the desire to fit in. You care about being a good person, but you also don’t want to lose friends. Like Jack, you sometimes make mistakes, but you are capable of real growth, apology, and loyalty.",
        justin: "Your decisions are reflective and intuitive. You think about how situations feel beneath the surface and prefer honesty and depth. Like Justin, you may avoid loud drama, but when it matters, you act to protect the people and values you care about."
